Hello, world! I am Ming Hong, but you can call me Ming. A geek at heart, I am the greatest fan of novelty; I consider the pursuit of knowledge as one of my life's goals, and I have a voracious appetite for new knowledge. It is this personality of mine that brought me into technology, as the boundless nature of the digital world led me down an endless spiral of learning. I have varied interests in many areas, although some of my primary interests are currently in:

* Information Security
* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Learning
* Software Engineering

I have a strong background in applied information security research and red teaming. I believe that a good offensive posture will help to identify the weaknesses in networks and systems, and knowledge of an attacker's perspective will be invaluable to me when I am designing systems and processes to secure enterprise networks. At a high level, I am also interested in how policies and proper information governance can minimise the information security risks to an organisation.

I enjoy challenges, and I seek to be kept on my toes by dynamic and fast-paced projects. In my free time, I tinker mostly with software but I have also been making a foray into hardware. I love to build and break things; while they may sound contradictory, they are actually complementary, as my red teaming experience has taught me.

I can be reached via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwekmh). I am always happy to make a new friend.
